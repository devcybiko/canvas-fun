* This is a major rewrite of our canvas code
* We moved all the 'state' values into arrays
  * `x, y, w, h,` and `color` do the obvious things
  * and `dx`, and `dy` are the deltas each object moves on each call to `timer()`
* We also removed the individual `redraw_n` functions 
  * and replaced them with a single function `draw(n)`
  * that takes an index into the arrays to draw the `nth` object
* `redraw()` now iterates over all the objects and 
* a new function `move(n)` adds the `dx` and `dy` (deltas) to the 'nth` object
* `timer()` now iterates over all the object arrays on each 'tick' of our clock (interval timer)
  * calls `move(n)` on each of them
  * then calls `redraw()` to redraw each of them
* NOTICE: We're calling the 'timer` every 1/4 second (250 milliseconds)
  * so our animation is running faster
* ALSO NOTICE: That the orange rectangle appears to move more 'slowly' than the other two
  * this is because the 'dx' value is only -5 instead of -10 pixels
  * this is a 'cheap' way of controlling the speed an object moves in an animation
  * the larger the delta, the faster it appears to move
  * the smaller the delta, the slower it appears to move
* ALSO, ALSO NOTICE: that when all three objects converge in the center
  * The orange appears on top, the green beneath it, and the red beneath all of them
  * This is again due to the order they are "painted" or "drawn"
  * The red object is painted first, so it appears to be the "furthest away"
  * The green object is painted next, so it appears to be "between" the other two
  * And the orange object is painted last, so it appears "on top"
  * This is called the "z order" of the objects
