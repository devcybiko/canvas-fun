## Summary
* To add animation, we update `Playfield` with the `timer` and `start` methods
  * `start()` kicks off a timer which calls `timer` every "tick" of our clock (1/8 sec or 125 msecs)
  * `timer()` is called every "tick" and calls `goAll()` and `redraw()`
  * `goAll()` iterates overall the objects and calls its `go()` method
    * `go()` is intended to be a generic method that just animates the object
  * `collisions(obj)` compares the rect of the `obj` to all the other objects
    * and returns an array of objects that intersect
* A new class `Meanderer` is created that inherits from `PObject`
  * `Meanderer` implements a `go()` method that allows the objects to wander around the playfield randomly
  * It also detects collisions between the objects so they bounce off each other
    * by calling `Playfield::collisions(obj)`
* The only changes to `Box` and `Circle` is that they now inherit from `Meanderer` which in turn inherits from `PObject`
* NOTE: This exposes a problem with JavaScript (and other single-inheritance languages) in that we had to change the object inheritance hierarchy to make the Box and Circle classes "Meander"
  * A better solution would be "mixins" that allow us to override the 'go()' method
