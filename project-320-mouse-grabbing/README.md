function handleMouseEvent(event) {
    console.log(event.button, event.buttons, event.type);
    if (event.type === "mouseup") drag = false;
    if (event.type === "mousedown") {
        if (event.offsetX > x 
            && event.offsetX < x + w 
            && event.offsetY > y 
            && event.offsetY < y + h) {
                drag = true;
            }
    }

* The only change here is in the `mousedown` handler
  * well that, and we are now using `w` and `h` to represent the width and height of our rectangle
* We do a check to see if the mouse pointer is within the bounds of our rectangle
  * We have to make sure the `offsetX` is between the rectangle's `x` and `x + w`
  * And, we have to make sure the `offsetY` is between the rectangle's `y` and `x + h`
* And, finally, when we do draw the rectangle, we move it to the center point of the rectangle using
  * half the `w` width and half the `h` height
  * `x = event.offsetX - w/2;`
  * `y = event.offsetY - h/2;`
* BUG: But the rectangle still `jumps` to the center point.
  * The next experiment will figure out the `grap point` and give the illusion that we've grabbed it in the right place
